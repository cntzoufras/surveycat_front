Also, it contains a few useful ready-to-use integrations and apps. You can use them as an example to build your own or implement them directly into your project.\nEasyDev has a good structure and code hence fits well for learning purposes."

Also, keep in mind that the template is not contains the back-end. To make an end-product you need to have knowledge or help with the back-end part."

    "answer": "Yes. And you are free to use it. However, please remember, if you use it for commercial products you need to buy an Extended license."
  }, {
    "question": "What’s the difference between regular and extended licenses?",
    "answer": "The regular license can be used for non-commercial end products (access is free and there will be no monthly subscription fee). You need to buy a new single regular license for each product you make or each domain you use if you set up it on multiple domains. An extended license can be used for end products (web service or SaaS) that charge users for access or service (e.g: monthly subscription fee). For more info on Themeforest licenses, you can check http://themeforest.net/licenses/standard?license=regular."
